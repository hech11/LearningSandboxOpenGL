# LearningSandboxOpenGL
If I ever wanted to learn Opengl. I should be using this library/project I made that enables me to quickly learn and experiment with OpenGL without the need to program "boiler plate" code. Everything should be set up as soon as i create a project using this library. This should contain utilities to quickly learn OpenGL, such as reading shader files, a window, input and event system, camera controllers, imgui and more features.
