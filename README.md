# LearningSandboxOpenGL
If I ever wanted to learn Opengl. I should be using this library/project I made that enables me to quickly learn and experiment with OpenGL without the need to program "boiler plate" code. 


Everything should be set up as soon as i create a project using this library.


This should contain utilities to quickly learn OpenGL, such as:

- Reading shader files
- A window context
- Input and event system
- Camera controllers
- Imgui for quick debugging


  and more features.
  
  
  This is purely for educational purposes and should be used to learn opengl without needing to "set up" a bunch of other things!
